### Project Title
Bikeshare

### Description
The project is about comparing usage in a bicycle-sharing system between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

A python script is created that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. Following questions will be asked and answered depending on the user input:

Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
(If month is chosen) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
(If day is chosen) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

There is also a possibility for the user to view the raw data.
