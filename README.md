### Project Title
Bikeshare US

### Description
The project is about comparing usage in a bicycle-sharing system between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

A python script is created that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. Following questions will be asked and answered depending on the user input:

Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
(If month is chosen) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
(If day is chosen) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

There is also a possibility for the user to view the raw data.

### Files used
Data files used:
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
chicago.csv

All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

### Credits
